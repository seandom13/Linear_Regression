# Linear_Regression

In this project, I work with artificial data from an Ecommerce company that sells clothing. They are wondering
whether they should invest more time and money into their website or mobile app. I have create a linear regression
model that will give them a more clear picture of which direction they would like to go. 

Throughout the project, I create visualizations for EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) that visualize a key relationships.
Then I create a linear regression model. The steps I took were to first prepare the model for a test_train_split of the 
data. The next step is to fit the data to the linear model. After I fit the data, I evaluated the performance by predicting
off the test values. The model looks like a good fit. I performed some metric calculations including the MAE(Mean Absolute Error, 
MSE(Mean Squared Error), and RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error). I also calculated the R-squared score and that scored a high 0.98, 
proving high accuracy. For a further analysis, I calculated the Coefficients of the model. So as we get closer to making a decision
about the company. We look at the effects of both. These are the conclusions we have been provided through our analysis. 

-Avg. Session Length: If you hold all the other features fixed a 1 unit increase in the Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of around $26 more spent.

-Time on App: If you hold all the other features fixed a 1 unit increase in the Time on App is associated with an increase of around $39 more spent.

-Time on Website: If you hold all othe features fixed a 1 unit increase in the Time on Website is associated with an increase of around $0.32 more spent.

-Length of Membership: If you hold all the other features fixed a 1 unit increase in the Length of Membership is associated with an increase of around $62 more spent.

Looking at these results, there is still a decision to be made. Should the company develop the website to catch up to the mobile app or develop the app more since it is working better. This is a decision that should be made after looking after other factors throughout the company.
